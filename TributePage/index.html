            <h2>A brief summary of Mother Teresa's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>
                Mother Teresa (given name was Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu) was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia). She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth. She later considered 27
                August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday". Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old. By age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself
                to religious life. She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas. She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931 and the final vows and the name Mother Tersa in 1937.

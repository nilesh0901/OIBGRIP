            <h2>A brief summary of Mother Teresa's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>
                Mother Teresa (given name was Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu) was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia). She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth. She later considered 27
                August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday". Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old. By age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself
                to religious life. She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas. She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931 and the final vows and the name Mother Tersa in 1937.

            <p>
                Mother Teresa has been commemorated by museums and named the patroness of a number of churches. She has had buildings, roads and complexes named after her, including Albania's international airport. Mother Teresa Day (Dita e Nënë Terezës), 19 October, is a public holiday in Albania. In 2009, the Memorial House of Mother Teresa was opened in her hometown of Skopje, North Macedonia. The Cathedral of Blessed Mother Teresa in Pristina, Kosovo, is named in her honour. The demolition of a historic high school building to make way for the new construction initially sparked controversy in the local community, but the high school was later relocated to a new, more spacious campus. Consecrated on 5 September 2017, it became the first cathedral in Mother Teresa's honour and the second extant one in Kosovo.
